                            There are times where I want or don't want affection such as

                            This can often be told by rather asking me or seeing if I'm being all cute and shy.

                                If you feel I look upset and may need a cuddle please turn to me and ask me if I'd like a cuddle. Premission to cuddle are things such as me putting my arms out in a cuddling motion, nodding my head after the question is asked or telling you that I do need a cuddle. When the cuddle is finished, if the situation is meant to show how much we love eachother then a

                                Kissing & Making out can be a really nice thing to do, sometimes even for hours. I don't enjoy tounge as I don't know what to do with it once in someones mouth or when it's in mine. This is one of the best ways to show your affection towards me, expecially when partnered with

                                Praise is something I didn't get much of when I was younger, and now it is one of the biggest factors that makes me feel safe, wanted and needed. If you want to make me happy or just make me feel wanted by you compliment me, praise me, it goes a long way. This can also be accompanied with 
                                <a href="#1.1" class="delinkify">Cuddles (1.1)</a> and/or

                                Flirting with me by doing things such as telling me I look pretty, mentioning that I'd look sexy in something or any other flirting method you can think of is a really nice thing for me to have happen to me. When someone is directly flirting with me and trying to make me feel good, I often do feel amazing.
                                <br> <br>
                                If there is someone in a call or with us that you want to flirt with, please flirt with me as well, I don't like feeling left out and often will make me feel like you don't love me or are using me.

                                I enjoy my Video Games, playing certain games will not only make me feel loved but also it's a good way to flirt with me when we aren't in the same room / location. You can do things such as getting me a pretty flower in Minecraft, or maybe you could calmly teach me about a game I want to learn. Having my hand held through a Video Game well you flirt with me is a great way for me to fall deeply in love with you, or solidify those feelings for you.

                            After a few months of seeing eachother it is nice to be defined as something as well as know what we both want to be in the future. This allows me to think about if my thoughts and feelings align with yours but it allows me to dictate how much time and effort I feel I need to put into us as a thing.

                                Me being Poly means that if I have any other Partners at the time, you will have to meet them. This don't mean you have to date, have sex or even enjoy being around them. This is mainly to show that when I am with either of you, you can not only put a name to a face but also know that I am safe.

                                I have very limited friends in my life but if we do regularly see each-other, then you will more than likely learn about a few of my friends, along with if I meet up with them are free to join us and meet them too. I ask for the same to be done (even meeting them online) as I want to know you are safe and always great to meet new people.

I ask for you to introduce me to your family members that are in your life as would love to meet the person who helped create you as a wonderful person.

                                I do enjoy physical touch and teasing, this can not only be a good way to turn me on but can be a great way to show your <a href="#1" class="delinkify">Affection (1)</a>. Just be warned to much physical touch can overwhelm me, I will tell you when I need a break through speach, double tapping or using a safe word.
