      <title>'No Code' is bad</title>
      <link>https://vex.blue/article/2024/09/05/no-code-is-bad</link>
      <description>Have you ever wanted to build a website? Did you know how to 'code' that website? No, well there's sites like Wix, Wordpress and Square out there that allows you to just drag-and-drop your whole website or simply add plugins. These systems are plainly not terrible if you are making a dynamic website with logins and things, especially if you want to join...</description>

      <title>Retitling Blog to Articles</title>
      <link>https://vex.blue/article/2024/09/04/retitling-blog-to-articles</link>
      <description>A few days ago I started writing 'blog' posts for this website, starting with Welcome to v2.2 where I wrote about version 2.2 of the VEX.blue website. After creating my second post Decentralised Social Media, i'd started to realised that this 'blog' was much more than just me writing about the updates for this website and that I'd most likely want to write about the topics I love talking to people about (but they often don't understand).</description>

      <title>Decentralised Social Media</title>
      <link>https://vex.blue/article/2024/09/03/decentralised-social-media</link>
      <description>Lately there's been plenty of talk about Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon and many more new Social Media platforms, along with something called the Fediverse. I thought I'd make a post about all of this, along with explain why we as VEX.blue actually love using these systems and encourage people to use them as well.</description>

      <title>Welcome to Version 2.2</title>
      <link>https://vex.blue/article/2024/09/02/welcome-to-v2.2</link>
      <description>Welcome to version 2.2 of the VEX.blue website, I recently was looking across our wonderful website here and realised that it didn't look so great, possible due to me coding it myself from HTML, CSS and JS (what I don't know much about). So I spent the past few days working on making this website more simple and usable for the general user. This is not only handy for my learning of 'What makes a good website' but also now is getting to the point that I am learning more of what I can do with static websites like this one.</description>
