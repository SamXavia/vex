    <title>Welcome to Version 2.2</title>
    <link>https://vex.blue/blog/2024/09/02/welcome-to-v2.2</link>
    <description>Welcome to version 2.2 of the VEX.blue website, I recently was looking across our wonderful website here and realised that it didn't look so great, possible due to me coding it myself from HTML, CSS and JS (what I don't know much about). So I spent the past few days working on making this website more simple and usable for the general user. This is not only handy for my learning of 'What makes a good website' but also now is getting to the point that I am learning more of what I can do with static websites like this one.</description>
